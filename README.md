# Clustering-Fitting_Applied_Data-Science1
## Introduction
The report analyzes a dataset titled "Top Expensive Leagues", which includes data about revenue, viewership, and the type of sport. The goal is to explore patterns, relationships, and distributions in the dataset using statistical techniques, visualizations, clustering methods, and regression modeling.
<br>**Dataset Description**
<br>The dataset, loaded from top_expensive_leagues.csv, contains details about various sports leagues, including:
<br>Revenue (USD): Revenue generated by each league.
<br>Viewership: Number of viewers for the respective league.
<br>Sport: The type of sport associated with the league.
## Descriptive Statistics
Summary statistics (mean, median, and standard deviation) were calculated.

## Relational Graph
**Scatter Plot**: Revenue vs. Viewership was plotted, with data points categorized by the type of sport.
<br>This visualization highlighted the trends between viewership numbers and revenue generation, showing distinct clusters for specific sports.

## Categorical Graph
**Bar Chart**: Displayed the distribution of sports leagues by category. This provided insights into the popularity or representation of different sports in the dataset.

## Statistical Graph
**HeatMap**: Identifies which variables are highly correlated (e.g., revenue and viewership).It highlights independent variables with no strong relationships.

## Clustering - KMeans with Silhouette/Elbow Plot
<br>Clustering was applied to segment leagues based on numerical variables like revenue and viewership.
<br>The dataset was scaled using StandardScaler to normalize the features before clustering.
<br>The Elbow Method determined the optimal number of clusters, minimizing within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS).
<br>Silhouette score evaluated the quality of clusters by measuring how well-separated they were.

## Fitting Technique - Line Fitting (Linear Regression)
**Linear Regression**:
<br>Modeled the relationship between Revenue (USD) (dependent variable) and Viewership (independent variable).
<br>The regression line was plotted on a scatter plot to visualize the goodness of fit.
<br>Metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared were used to evaluate performance.
**Polynomial Regression**:
<br>Applied to better fit non-linear relationships between revenue and viewership.

## Insights
**Revenue vs. Viewership**:
<br>A positive correlation was observed: leagues with higher viewership tend to generate more revenue.
<br>Specific sports dominated revenue generation, creating distinct clusters.
<br>**Categorical Distribution**:
<br>Certain sports (e.g., football) had significantly higher representation in the dataset.
<br>**Clustering**:
<br>The clustering process grouped leagues into distinct categories based on revenue and viewership, providing actionable insights for segment-based analysis.
<br>**Regression**:
<br>The linear model performed well, though some non-linear relationships were better captured using polynomial regression.
## Conclusion
The analysis revealed meaningful patterns and relationships in the dataset. The clustering approach segmented the leagues effectively, while regression models provided predictive capabilities for estimating revenue based on viewership. These results are valuable for stakeholders aiming to optimize revenue generation strategies.
